These long-baseline, Michelson interferometers increase the sensitivity between 10 and 40 Hz by many orders of magnitude compared with first generation instruments.

In this paper we investigate the requirements on the attenuation of scattered light using a novel time-domain analysis and two years of seismic data from the LIGO Livingston Observatory.},

abstract = {The second generation of ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors are currently being built and installed. They are designed to be better in strain sensitivity by about a factor 10 with respect to the first generation. Light originating from the laser and following unintended paths, called stray light, has been a major problem during the commissioning of all of the first generation detectors. Indeed, stray light carries information about the phase of the emitting object. Therefore, in the next generation all the optics will be suspended in the vacuum in order to mitigate their associated stray light displacement noise. Despite this additional precaution, the challenging target sensitivity at low frequency which is partially limited by quantum radiation pressure combined with up-conversion effects, requires more detailed investigation. In this paper, we turn our attention to stray light originating from auxiliary optical benches. We use a dedicated formalism to compute the re-coupling of back-reflected and back-scattered light. We show, in particular, how much care should be taken in designing and setting requirements for the input bench optics.},

The design is based on that used in GEO600—the German/UK interferometric gravitational wave detector, with further development to meet the more stringent noise requirements for Advanced LIGO. The test mass suspensions consist of a four-stage or quadruple pendulum for enhanced seismic isolation. To minimize suspension thermal noise, the final stage consists of a silica mirror, 40 kg in mass, suspended from another silica mass by four silica fibres welded to silica ears attached to the sides of the masses using hydroxide-catalysis bonding. The design is chosen to achieve a displacement noise level for each of the seismic and thermal noise contributions of 10−19 m/√Hz at 10 Hz, for each test mass. We discuss features of the design which has been developed as a result of experience with prototypes and associated investigations.}

abstract = "The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser-interferometric detectors requires sensitivity to changes in distance much smaller than the diameter of atomic nuclei. Though sophisticated machinery and techniques have been developed over the past few decades to isolate such instruments from non-astrophysical noise, the detectors are still susceptible to instrumental and environmental noise transients known as “glitches,” which hinder searches for transient gravitational waves. The Gravity Spy project is an effort to comprehensively classify the glitches that afflict gravitational wave detectors into morphological families by combining the strengths of machine learning algorithms and citizen scientists. This paper presents the initial Gravity Spy dataset used for citizen scientist and machine learning classification – a static, accessible, documented dataset for testing machine learning supervised classification. Previous versions of this dataset used in [8, 53] did not include all current classes and also for some of the classes, some samples were pruned and added. This set consists of time–frequency images of LIGO glitches and their associated metadata. These glitches are organized by time–frequency morphology into 22 classes for which descriptions and representative images are presented. Results from the application of state-of-the-art supervised classification methods to this dataset are presented in order to provide baselines for future glitch classification work. Standard splitting for training, validation, and testing sets are also presented to facilitate the comparison between different machine learning methods. The baseline methods are selected from both traditional and more recent deep learning approaches. An ensemble framework is developed that demonstrates that combining various classifiers can yield a more accurate model for classification. The ensemble classifier, trained with the standard training set, achieves 98.21% accuracy on the standard test set."

	abstract = {The {Advanced} {LIGO} detectors are currently in their final design stage, and the installation phase will start at the end of 2010: they will have about 10 times better sensitivity than initial LIGO, with a sensitive band ranging from 10 Hz to 10 kHz. As compared with previous LIGO detectors, there will be increased complexity in the optical configuration, improved seismic isolation system and significantly higher power circulating in the arm cavities. In the new detectors, the control of the angular orientation of the mirrors will be particularly challenging. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO) mirrors need to have a residual angular motion of the order of 1 nrad RMS in order to achieve high sensitivity. In the high power regime, the torque induced by radiation pressure effects will be comparable with the restoring torque of the mirror suspension, such that we must think of the opto-mechanical response, instead of just the mechanical response. These modifications have to be considered in order to design the control strategy for keeping the mirrors well aligned. Moreover, to meet the sensitivity target the alignment control noise coupled to the gravitational-wave channel must be well below  at 10 Hz. We developed a model of the alignment sensing and control scheme of aLIGO which takes into account radiation pressure effects and meets the noise target.}
